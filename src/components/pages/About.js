      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a student in a part-time full-stack development bootcamp
        through UNC-Chapel Hill. I work as a Product Owner in Fidelity
        Charitable, the philanthropy arm of Fidelity Investments. I support two
        development teams that are tasked with enhancing applications to improve
        the customer and associate experience. I enrolled in the bootcamp to get
        a deeper understanding of development so that I can better serve my team
        and our end users.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        After this course, I hope to continue my coding journey by picking up
        side projects and using what I have learned. I also plan on
        incorporating my new knowledge in my day job, making me a better Product
        Owner by being able to understand the language the developers on my team
        are speaking. Eventually, I would like to change my career trajectory to
        include more of a development focus and less of a Product Owner focus.
